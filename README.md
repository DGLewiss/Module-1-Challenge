# Overview and Origin
BlackRock was founded in 1988 by eight founders, Larry Fink, Robert Kapito, Susan Wagner, Barbara Novick, Ben Golub, Hugh Frater, Ralph Schlosstein, and Keith Anderson. BlackRock operates in the asset management domain managing over 9 trillion USD as of the end of quarter one 2023, AUM globally is approximately $97t. The Assets Under Management (AUM) are invested from an array of clients including governments, insurance and pension funds and individual investors. BlackRock has recently shifted its focus towards an environmental, social and governance (ESG) approach with investment management, involving sustainability considerations in its largely data-driven decision-making process. BlackRock also provides risk management and financial advisory services to its diverse base of clients to improve financial outcomes in periods of increased market volatility. BlackRock's additional key service is the Aladdin (Asset, Liability and Debt and Derivative Investment Network) the investment management platform provides institutional or individual users a streamlined experience when managing wealth. As a result of BlackRock’s influence in financial markets, there is some debate around its role in the global financial ecosystem.

# Landscape

BlackRock’s Aladdin provides an array of services that justify a position in multiple domains within the financial industry. The discipline that BlackRock's Aladdin ticks the most boxes with is asset management. As technology applications continue to advance and our dependence on technology grows, innovations within the industry progress quickly. Key trends encompass the optimisation of processes through digital transformation, implementation of AI, Machine learning and improvement in quantitative analysis. Machine learning systems and AI are often implemented to support another trend in the industry, improving client experience and satisfaction with service. Clients of asset management firms are also shifting toward a ‘greener’ investment portfolio, putting their money where their values are. Growing awareness of environmental and social impacts on financial performance requires firms to demonstrate ESG consideration in investment decisions and offer ESG-concentrated investments.
