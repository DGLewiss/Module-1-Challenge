# Overview and Origin
BlackRock was founded in 1988 by eight founders, Larry Fink, Robert Kapito, Susan Wagner, Barbara Novick, Ben Golub, Hugh Frater, Ralph Schlosstein, and Keith Anderson. BlackRock operates in the asset management domain managing over 9 trillion USD as of the end of quarter one 2023, AUM globally is approximately $97t. The Assets Under Management (AUM) are invested from an array of clients including governments, insurance and pension funds and individual investors. BlackRock has recently shifted its focus towards an environmental, social and governance (ESG) approach with investment management, involving sustainability considerations in its largely data-driven decision-making process. BlackRock also provides risk management and financial advisory services to its diverse base of clients to improve financial outcomes in periods of increased market volatility. BlackRock's additional key service is the Aladdin (Asset, Liability and Debt and Derivative Investment Network) the investment management platform provides institutional or individual users a streamlined experience when managing wealth. As a result of BlackRock’s influence in financial markets, there is some debate around its role in the global financial ecosystem.





# Business Activities

BlackRock’s Aladdin is the investment management tool of choice for over 55,000 investment professionals and 200 institutional clients. The platform assists users with portfolio, risk and data management, compliance, regulations and client servicing. Aladdin’s latest ability is ESG integration enabling customers to factor ESG analytics into investment decision-making. Sustainable business operations are imperative for corporations to future-proof their positions. Recently structured tax provisions such as the inflation reduction act are passed to support investment into renewable energy transition and sustainable technologies. Therefore, investors obtaining insight into tax policies with ESG strategies provide an opportunity for differentiated investment outcomes. BlackRock’s Aladdin positions itself between the legislative change and investors to support ESG investments and accelerate economic prosperity in this sector.
